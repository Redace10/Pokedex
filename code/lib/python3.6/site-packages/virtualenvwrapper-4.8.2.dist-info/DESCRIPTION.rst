virtualenvwrapper
#################

virtualenvwrapper is a set of extensions to Ian Bicking's `virtualenv
<http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv>`_ tool.  The extensions include
wrappers for creating and deleting virtual environments and otherwise
managing your development workflow, making it easier to work on more
than one project at a time without introducing conflicts in their
dependencies.

**Warning:** The 4.x release includes some potentially incompatible
changes for extensions from 3.x. The python modules for extensions are
now *always* run with ``PWD=$WORKON_HOME`` (previously the value of
PWD varied depending on the hook). The *shell* portion of any hook
(anything sourced by the user's shell when the hook is run) is still
run in the same place as before.

========
Features
========

1.  Organizes all of your virtual environments in one place.

2.  Wrappers for creating, copying and deleting environments, including
    user-configurable hooks.

3.  Use a single command to switch between environments.

4.  Tab completion for commands that take a virtual environment as
    argument.

5. User-configurable hooks for all operations.

6. Plugin system for more creating sharable extensions.

showing off the features of virtualenvwrapper.

============
Installation
============

See the `project documentation
<http://www.doughellmann.com/docs/virtualenvwrapper/>`__ for
installation and setup instructions.

Supported Shells
================

virtualenvwrapper is a set of shell *functions* defined in Bourne
shell compatible syntax.  It is tested under ``bash``, ``ksh``, and ``zsh``.
It may work with other shells, so if you find that it does work with a
shell not listed here please let me know.  If you can modify it to
work with another shell, without completely rewriting it, send a pull
request through the bitbucket project page.  If you write a clone to
work with an incompatible shell, let me know and I will link to it
from this page.

Python Versions
===============

virtualenvwrapper is tested under Python 2.6 - 3.6.

Support
=======

Join the `virtualenvwrapper Google Group
<http://groups.google.com/group/virtualenvwrapper/>`__ to discuss
issues and features.  

Report bugs via the `bug tracker on Bitbucket
<https://bitbucket.org/virtualenvwrapper/virtualenvwrapper/issues>`__.

Shell Aliases
=============

Since virtualenvwrapper is largely a shell script, it uses shell
commands for a lot of its actions.  If your environment makes heavy
use of shell aliases or other customizations, you may encounter
issues.  Before reporting bugs in the bug tracker, please test
*without* your aliases enabled.  If you can identify the alias causing
the problem, that will help make virtualenvwrapper more robust.
